#Idea of wrapping data and methods that work on data within one unit
#hiding the data
#you can Restrict access to methods and variables. 
#This can prevent the data from being modified by accident
#Encapsulation prevents from accessing accidentally, but not intentionally
#A private variable can only be changed within a class method and not outside of the class(prefixes using double underscore)
#every variable by default is a public variable,accessed and modifies anywhere
#protected(single underScore) can be accessed in subclass unlike privates cannot be accessed outside class
