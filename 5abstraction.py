#Abstract class can’t be instantiated so it is not possible to create objects of an abstract class
#Abstract class can have both concrete methods as well as abstract methods.
#Generally abstract methods defined in abstract class don’t have any body but it is possible to have abstract methods with implementation in abstract class. Any sub class deriving from such
# abstract class still needs to provide implementation for such abstract methods.
#If any abstract method is not implemented by the derived class Python throws an error.
#Since abstract class are supposed to have abstract methods having no body so abstract classes 
# are not considered as complete concrete classes thus it is not possible to instantiate an abstract class
