#Errors can also occur at runtime and these are called exceptions
#Code enters the else block only if the try block doesnt raises an exception
#LEARN how to raise USER DEFINED EXCEPTIONS.
#They occur, for example, when a file we try to open does not exist(FileNotFoundError), 
# dividing a number by zero(ZeroDivisionError), module we try to import is not found(ImportError)
#The try statement can have optional "final" statement 
#This final clause is executed no matter what, and is generally used to release external resources like closing a file etc.
